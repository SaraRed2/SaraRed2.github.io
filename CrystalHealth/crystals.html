          A beginner's guide to crystals
        </h3>
        <p>
          Crystal healing is a type of alternative therapy that involves using gemstones to bring balance to an individual's life and mind. Crystals are said to have a stable and unchanging energy pattern, each with a unique frequency and energy field, or resonance that gives them special properties.
          As a result, they act like tuning forks, helping bring harmony to the "very unstable energy field of the human body.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the world of alternative medicine, crystals are said to have healing properties that–when holding them or placing them on your body–can promote physical, emotional and spiritual healing. Crystals are used to interact with your body’s energy field, also known as an individual’s chakra.

          For instance, salicylic acid is found in the plant meadowsweet and is used to make aspirin. Aspirin can cause the lining of the stomach to bleed, but meadowsweet naturally contains other compounds that prevent irritation from salicylic acid. 
        </p>
        <p>
          According to herbal medicine practitioners, the effect of the whole plant is greater than its parts. Critics argue that the nature of herbal medicine makes it difficult to give a measured dose of an active ingredient.

          The benefits of crystals
        </h3>
        <p>
          The proposed healing benefits of crystals predominantly surround areas of mental wellbeing; including feelings of increased tranquility, positivity and focus, as well as enhanced immunity and pain relief.
        </p>
        <p> 
          Individual crystals are also known to have their own special energies that align to different areas of your life, with their shape and colour - as well as their type - affecting their influence.

                <p>
                    Rhodonite is manganese silicate mineral with an opaque transparency. Rhodonite comes in shades that vary from pale pink to deep red. It has a vitreous luster and is composed of other minerals such as calcite, iron, and magnesium. It has a triclinic crystal system and occurs in ores or as rounded crystals.

                <p>
                    While much of Rhodonites power is attributed to its beautiful emotional and spiritual properties, that doesn’t mean it falls short when it comes to bringing a breath of fresh healing air to your body too. The Rhodonite crystal is softly invigorating and gifts you a strength you never knew you had. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    For those who feel their energy is drained (particularly after a strong emotional spell or after a bout of trauma) then Rhodonite’s soothing vibrations are enough to bring you back to life. Of course, it connects with the heart and circulatory system, keeping your ticker beating bright. The rose stone also sends energy to the endocrine system along with curing stomach ulcers, aiding digestion and helping with autoimmune diseases. It also helps the body heal from scarring and can take the sting out of insect bites.

                    Healing emotional wounds and putting you on the pathway to complete unconditional love – when it comes to mental and emotional wellbeing this is where Rhodonite shines. For those who want to clear their heart of pain and bring down the barriers that may be holding them back, Rhodonite is ready to go to work on helping you dismantle anything that could be having a negative impact on your self-worth.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All love starts with self-love and the more we are able to stand in the light of our own self-confidence and our own talents, the better equipped we can be to turn that love outwards and send it spiraling into the universe. If you have issues with abandonment or betrayal or anything that translates to unhealthy attitudes towards relationships, Rhodonite can be an amazing relationship counsellor to get your love life back on track. It’s a stone that encourages mutual understanding and the ability to embrace compromise from a place of pure and honest acceptance.
                </p>
                <h5>Metaphysical Properties</h5>
                <p>
                    As mentioned, Rhodonite has a huge connection to the heart chakra. The heart chakra is where our love, trust, and ability to bring compassion comes from. As life can be brimming with hard knocks, it's our heart chakra that can often take the hit. We throw up walls, we shut down, and our trust levels diminish. When we work to clear the blockages that clog up the heart space, we may find ourselves healed and in harmony and able to bring about healthy levels of love both internally and externally.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Those Rhodonite crystals that come swirled with plenty of darker patches also resonate strongly with the root chakra. This is our place of safety, its how we root into the earth beneath our feet and it all relates to our sense of security in the world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It goes without saying that as a stone of deep love, Rhodonite comes with more than a pinch of positivity. It brings joy and energy and a spark that can light up a room. If you feel like you need some added power in reducing the negative energy in your life then you can also pair Rhodonite with Sugilite for even more intense action.

For those who want to connect deeper to their third eye, using the gemstone as a spiritual amplifier to higher realms could benefit the aura, although it’s worth remembering that the Tiger Eye is more an earthly root chakra stone.

                    Death could be considered a transition, a change, and a leap to a higher realm and while of course there is grief in letting go of someone who is loved, there is also life to be celebrated and memories to be most cherished. Amethyst reminds us that in spirituality, there is also balance – it isn’t all about bypassing the negative and thinking that spiritual awakening leads to only positive thinking, but also recognizing the darkness and honoring it without holding it forever in the heart.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It also works wonderfully for those who tend to be quick to anger as it effectively dissipates the growth of rage and replaces it with a halo of serenity that can be hard to cut through.

                    While Amethyst works to sweep negativity away from clouding the mind, it also seems to trigger a spark that unveils our deepest wells of inspiration. When our mind is calm and focused we are able to tap into our creative mind and unveil all those ideas and interests that were stashed behind the wall of inner chaos.
                </p>

                    For those who struggle with the art of decision making, Amethyst can also help to harness the inner power needed to make choices that work for the individual.

                <h5>Metaphysical Properties</h5>
                <p>
                    For those who are looking to leap higher into their spiritual awakening, Amethyst is one of the most important stones in the healing pack. It is strongly associated with the crown chakra and is even said to bridge the gap between the physical and the spiritual realms.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The third eye chakra is known for being one of the most powerful intuitive tools to have in the pack. Everyone has the gift of intuition, it's all about how they harness it. As Amethyst kindles the third eye to awaken, it grants the sixth sense to bloom into being. In eastern philosophy, it is said that the third eye is the spiritual center of a person’s existence. It's also responsible for how people perceive reality and how open they are to opening the door and stepping out into spiritual enlightenment. The color associated with the third eye chakra is indigo which also links to the color of Amethyst. When the third eye chakra is blocked, people may struggle with feelings of depression and anxiety, and maybe feel the weight of cynicism heavy on their soul. By awakening the third eye, one can awaken intuition, let their inner wisdom flow, and invite the sparkle back to their imagination.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The crown chakra is the sacred energy center and also intricately connected with the Amethyst stone. Its where the cosmic consciousness sits and is where people receive those much-needed messages from the universe and the connection to the cosmos. When the crown chakras power is untapped or there is a block, people may feel alienated or disconnected from the world around them. They may feel their ego gets in the way too much. When the crown chakra is open and ready to receive, there is balance, wellbeing, deeper connection and a working confidence in one own’s wisdom.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With a long history as an amulet for protection it’s no surprise that Amethyst works to counteract the negative energies of external environments. Amethyst can ward of physical attacks; lending protection against misfortune. On a spiritual level it also helps protect the mind against black magic and emotional manipulation.

                    What is Citrine?
                </h5>
                <p>
                    Citrine is in the mineral class of quartz. It takes its color from the traces of iron in the quartz and can be anything from pale yellow to bright shades of amber. Citrine tends to have a hexagonal crystal system and in its natural form has a cloudy or smoky look. The meaning of citrine is focused on prosperity, joy, and energy.

                <p>
                    Just like standing in the gentle glow of sunlight, Citrine works wonders when it comes to warming the physical body and bringing uplifting moods. If Vitamin D were a stone it would be Citrine for sure. Bringing Citrine into your life means that you can say farewell to sluggish vibes. An instant pick me up, Citrine brings a bounty of energy and can be an amazing gift to those who suffer from chronic fatigue or other conditions that run your personal resources low.

                <p>
                    While Citrine is an energy giver, it doesn’t mean she amps you up into overdrive, it’s a stone that will pull you up by your bootstraps but not leave you out of balance. Citrine helps to keep the thyroid working well, stimulate a healthy digestive system, better blood circulation, and keeps allergies and all kinds of skin irritations on the down-low. Those who suffer from menstrual pain and a cycle that seems out of whack will also love the healing vibes of Citrine and it can also be used as a remedy against nausea too.

Citrine can help you to fight phobias through the gentle flow of healing energy and knowing that no matter what, you are able to take accountability for your own safety and that you simply will not fail.

                <p>
                    Citrine is connected to the Solar Plexus Chakra and the Sacral Chakra, and both these power points in the body sit either in the center or down low. These are elemental chakras that help us to stay grounded and glorious in our own power. The Solar Plexus Chakra is where we garner our warrior strength and stand strong in personal power. If your Solar Plexus Chakra is blocked you may struggle to feel centered and your confidence will sit on shaky ground. This makes it hard to forge boundaries and also may mean that you struggle to keep negative energy out.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Sacral Chakra is where our passion, creativity and intimacy sits close to our pubic bone. This is also where the well of our joy sits. If your Sacral Chakra is blocked you may feel overwhelmed like you are spinning in a loss of control, and this can lead to feelings of detachment or emotionally checking out.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As Citrine works to bring both these chakras into alignment, you can see it’s a really great tool for those who just need a little extra help staying grounded without feeling ground down. Ward off negative energy, bring your inner strength shimmering to the surface and let the hardships of life roll off like water on a duck's back with this purely positive stone.

                    The other name for which Rose Quartz is known is as The Heart Stone. As mentioned, Rose Quartz is intricately connected to the heart chakra, and this crystal is often used in helping the heart heal from the pain or trauma left from deep emotional wounds. Rose Quartz is also used as a calling card for those who crave more love in their lives. This doesn’t always need to take the form of romantic love, but more in finding a deep sense of compassion and care in this world – especially if it comes from one of the most important sources who can bring it – oneself.

                <p>
                    If your heart chakra feels blocked you may experience the signs of unhealthy behavior when it comes to relationships. Maybe you will lean more towards co-dependence, be quick to jealousy, have little trust in yourself or others, and often feel unwilling or unworthy enough to give yourself to the grace of love. One of the most stunning Rose Quartz healing properties is its ability to crack open the heart and put you back in alignment so you feel connected, comforted, and open to all the possibilities that a joyous life can bring.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another beautiful benefit of Rose Quartz is her deep vibration and attunement with the goddess energy. Rose Quartz is connected with the feminine divine, meaning that it carries the aura of compassion and peace and the warmth of mothering – all with the superior strength of spirit. If you feel you need to learn how to self soothe, to be healed by your own hands, and to uplift your own potential into the goddess sphere, then Rose Quartz is a path that will take you there.

When our heart chakras are blocked we struggle to show the full spectrum of our love and to let others in to share the gorgeous nature of our souls. Malachite goes straight to work on the heart chakra, removing the blocks so that beauty can flow. It doesn’t stop at the heart either, Malachite works across the chakras, strengthening your Solar Plexus Chakra so you are able to feel grounded and brimming with vitality. It’s a chi stirrer of a stone that’s for sure. It also taps into your Third Eye Chakra, where our infinite wisdom and our deepest intuition sit. When our Third Eye is clear to open, it means that we are leaping higher spiritually and that’s when magic can be manifested and psychic visions even have a chance to seep in.

                While some may shy away from the darker hues of the Obsidian Stone for something that brings brighter hues to the party, it’s important to remember that everything in life is all about balance. Without the night there is no day, without the darkness there is no light. This is where Obsidian swoops in to serve you. It is a truth-seeker stone and rather than encourage you to walk in falsehood, it is more about finding ways to face up to all the different angles of yourself so that you are full and ready and invulnerable when it is finally time to step into that light.

            <p>

            <h5>Metaphysical Properties</h5>
            <p>
                One of the strongest connections you can expect from your Obsidian Stone is its ability to strengthen your root chakra. This is one of the most important chakras we have as it is known for keeping us grounded no matter what is going on in the world around us. When the root chakra is blocked, we feel untethered and suddenly unstable, as though danger or negativity waits at every turn. With Obsidian sending its healing energy straight where it is needed, you can stand safe and strong and without the risk of any kind of psychic attack.
            </p>
            <p>
                For centuries sages and healers also turned to the power of Obsidian to help tap into that third eye chakra. They believed the mirror-like qualities of Obsidian could provide a glimpse into another realm and could guide the way towards higher knowledge and cosmic consciousness. The Black Obsidian Stone is also known for helping out when it comes to your solar plexus chakra. This is our third chakra in the body and is best associated with the place where our self-esteem and sense of worth flows from. When the solar plexus is blocked it can send us off balance and make us feel lost, flailing, or even shy in our own skin. Using the Obsidian mirror you can look within and remove the blockage that is keeping you from living out your very best life without the confinements of fear.

It eases away doubts, even when the cause is unknown, and calms worries about money by providing solutions not previously considered.

It may help balance disturbances in the electrical impulses of the brain, and is supportive for hard to treat progressive illnesses.

                    Moldavite is a stone of the heart, reaching into the deepest inner self and bringing to the surface that which one most needs to recognize, honor, integrate or release. Its resonance brings the heart into union with the mind, allowing them to work together in partnership.

Those who dislike Moldavite’s deep green color often have an aversion to emotion and need to experience unconditional love to find wholeness. They may also have hidden emotional trauma that needs to surface and heal, for which other crystals are required.

                    Bloodstone is all about going to work on those lower chakras. It wants you fully grounded and secure so all that vital energy can flow from tip to toe. Where Bloodstone connects the strongest is with your root chakra. The root chakra could be considered something like our safety net. Its what keeps us anchored, grounded, and like the root of a tree – how we hold ourselves in place when the winds around us are blowing. Not only does Bloodstone beautifully strengthen that relationship with the root chakra, but it also works wonders when it comes to the heart chakra. The heart chakra is where our love, trust, compassion, and ability to open ourselves up can be found. When we deal with these blockages, suddenly we find ourselves in a space of great healing- open-hearted, quick to joy, and ever ready to stand in the light of what the wilder world has to offer. Bloodstone helps you to clear out the smog of negative energy, it says stress and irritability be gone and brings a smooth energy flow that is soaked in good fortune.

                    Ruby is considered a blood stone, strengthening the heart, myocardium, ventricles and coronaries, and stimulating good circulation and blood flow. It is also an aid in treating disorders or disease of the heart.

                <p>
                    Ruby assists in regulating menstrual flow and alleviating pain associated with menstruation. It is considered beneficial for the reproductive organs, and is often used for treatment of sexual dysfunction, impotence and infertility, early menopause, and as a support for gynecological operations. It is believed to be helpful during pregnancy, especially for older women, and in the optimum formation of children in the embryonic state.

                    Ruby allows the sharing of loving energy despite past hurts, bringing up anger or negative energy for transmutation. It gives the strength to rise from martyrdom and choose whether or not to dwell in anguish, distress, or suffering, and encourages a positive and more courageous state of mind. It brings out the protective aspects of one’s character, inspiring one to step forward and stand up for those who are threatened, be it friends or strangers, children, animals, or the environment.
                <p>
                    Ruby also sustains and protects those with sensitive natures and distorted views of themselves or others. It overcomes fears of being “ugly” or unloved, and is particularly empowering for those who hold excess weight in the body in order to ground in the physical world. It releases destructive emotional holds, and is a powerful stone for developing a more loving attitude toward oneself and the physical body.

                <p>
                    Ruby signifies light to the darkness of one’s life. It encourages “following your bliss,” teaching one to enjoy being in the physical world and perceiving the spiritual energy that exists throughout the realm of matter. It offers lessons in mastering the transformation of thought and intent into physical manifestation in order to change one’s world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ruby assists in connecting one’s energy field to the Earth for the purpose of replenishing one’s energy stores. It is excellent for grounding and overcoming mental overload, and is a great support during times of stress or when there is a lengthy sojourn before having the opportunity to rest.
